calculate the new x y pos
put ghost to new x y pos
if ghost is in collision with floor and player direction is down and floor is under the player{
    player vpeed = 0
    player new x y on the floor
}
if ghost is in collision with solid{
    player vspeed = 0
    player new x y adjacent to the solid
}
if ghost is in collision with slope and player direction is down and slope is under the player{
    player vspeed = 0
    player new x y adjacent to the slope according to the slope angle and the x of player
}
if ghost is in collision with moving platform and player direction is down and moving platform is under the player{
    player vspeed = 0
    player new x y adjacent to the moving platform according to the moving platform next x y
}
